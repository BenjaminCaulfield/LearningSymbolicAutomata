\begin{abstract}
Symbolic  automata allow transitions to carry predicates over
rich alphabet theories, such as linear arithmetic, and therefore extend
classic automata to operate over infinite alphabets, such as
the set of rational numbers. 
%Existing automata algorithms rely
%on the alphabet being finite, and generalizing them to the symbolic
%setting is not a trivial task.
In this paper, we study the foundational problem of learning symbolic automata.
We first present \alg,
a symbolic automata extension of Angluin's L$^*$
algorithm for learning regular languages.
Then, we define notions of learnability that are parametric in the alphabet theories
of the symbolic automata and show how these notions nicely compose.
Specifically, we show that if two alphabet theories are \emph{learnable},
then the theory accepting the Cartesian product or disjoint union of their alphabets is also learnable.
Using these properties, we show
how existing algorithms for learning automata over large alphabets nicely fall in our framework.
Finally, we implement our algorithm in an open-source library and evaluate it on existing automata learning benchmarks.
